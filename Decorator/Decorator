callable python object

In decorator1.py: 
str_upper is returning the refernce of inner function.
d is holding the refernce.
print(d): prints the memory location of the function.
print(d.__name__): prints inner(name of the function it is refering)
if d() is called then we get the output in uppercase.

this whole thing is done by decorator.
